# Description

 This repository is an on-going and *evolving* explorations of how to calculate the constant **&pi;** (the ratio of a circle's circumference to its
 radius).

Initially, this will involve the simplest possible front-end only implementation using the simplest method for doing this calculation.

Ultimately, other more sophisticated and/or more efficient methods of calculation will be explored, considerations for higher precision will be incorporated and perhaps later versions might entertain considerations like:

- persisting the state of a calculation so that it can be continued at a later time - at first maybe just locally (cookies) and, later on a server

- distributing the calculations over multiple parallel processors

Realistically, there is no expectation of exceeding the precision and efficiency already achieved by others, the output of which is already publicly available (e.g. see below (TODO)).  Thus, this is mostly just an environment in which I can personally explore the various calculation methods and the various technologies in which those methods might be implemented.

Even so, I hope others might find some of the content interesting.

# Technologies

Project is created with:

- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- SVG (TODO)

(As of 3/14/2024.  Other technologies to be added as this project continues to evolve.)

## Installation

As, for now, this is a strictly front-end implementation, all that is necessary is:

- Select the green **"<span style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#008000"><> Code â–¼</span>"** button on this repository's landing page [TODO link].

- From the drop-down, select "Download ZIP".

- Save the resulting "pi-project-main.zip" file to the location of your choice (preferably into an *empty* folder/directory).

- Unpack the pi-project-main.zip file using the zip/unzip utility appropriate for your platform.


## Usage

*For now*, once installed as described above, simply open the included index.html file with your internet browser - by double-clicking, explicitly opening the file, or whatever other action might be appropriate for your platform.

*(Ultimately, it is likely that this same front-end only implementation will be made available as a URL on github, but that is not the case at this moment.)*
